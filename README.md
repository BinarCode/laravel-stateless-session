# CSRF verification and session persistent through request/response headers.

This is a lightweight package which allow you to manage a session in a stateless communication (REST/API) when the
API domain and main web application domain are different.

E.g. 
- API hosted under: `api.foo.com`
- WEB hosted under: `tenant1.com`, `tenant2.com` etc.


In that case you cannot set cookie for different main domains 

[See why you cannot set cookie under different domain.](https://blog.webf.zone/ultimate-guide-to-http-cookies-2aa3e083dbae)



## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require binarcode/laravel-stateless-session
```

## Usage

1. Trigger session, make a GET request to: `/api/csrf-header`. This will return a header with the session key and an optional header with CSRF token `XSRF-TOKEN`. 
The header name could be configured in: `stateless.header`

2. Use this session key for every request you want to take care of the session.

3. If you want to benefit of the CSRF protection of your requests, you should add the follow middleware to your routes:
```php
->middleware(Binarcode\LaravelStatelessSession\Http\Middleware\VerifyHeaderCsrfToken::class);
```

Now the server will return 419 (Page expired code). Unless you send back a request header named: `X-CSRF-TOKEN` with the value received by the first GET request in the `XSRF-TOKEN` header.

That's it.

At this point you have CSRF protection. 

And you can play with `SessionManager` and use the `session()` helper to store/get information (e.g. flash sessions).

## Config

The lifetime and other options could be set as before in the `session` file.

The `VerifyHeaderCsrfToken` and `StartStatelessSession` middlewares will inject into headers the session key.

The session key name could be configured in the:

```php
stateless.header => env('STATELESS_HEADER', 'X-STATELESS-HEADER')
```

Danger: The key name separators should use `-` not `_` [according with this.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).
